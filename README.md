## Description of the Website

As already mentioned, this website is intended to showcase my portfolio projects. With this view in mind, it features two main sections.

The first section contains the featured work, where a number of my projects are listed. They all link to their corresponding repository on GitHub.

The second section is a contact me one. Here, the visitor can obtain some information to get in touch. In particular, I can be contacted by email and via my GitHub profile.

## Getting Started

This is a fully browser-based application, so you will only need a browser to run it. There are no external dependencies.

In addition, it is noteworthy that the application has been written with responsiveness in mind. As a result, it is fully functional on a range of different devices, including phones, tablets and desktop computers.

It is made up of a number of files. The main ones are:

* index.html: It contains the application's HTML code.
* css\main.css: It contains the application's CSS code.
* img\: It contains the images used in this website.
* README.md: It contains the documentation file you are viewing right now.

The application can be started by simply running the index.html file on a browser.

## Contributing

This repository contains all the code that makes up the application. Even though this is my personal portfolio website, any feedback will be greatly appreciated. As a result, I will be more than happy to consider any pull requests.
